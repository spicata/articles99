# Learning from FOSS

## An Introduction

Free and Open Source Software is a class of software that is... well, free and open source. It follows two major guidelines: it is both (1) gratis (free of change) and libre (free to be used). Many modern systems use lots of these FOSS softwares, and lots of modern apps are built upon other FOSS apps. A great example would be the git version control manager, and also the Linux operating system.

These FOSS softwares are often not controlled by a single person. Rather, they are usually community maintained by people from around the world. This means that anyone who can program can contribute to the development of these app.

However, this is not always satisfactory. Sometimes, FOSS apps become deprecated or discontinued. Other times, people are just not happy with the app itself, and want a more substantial change. This is where the nature of it being open source really shines, because at these times, people are able to easily copy over the code of the FOSS software and remix it to their liking.

This system ensures that things can constantly be developed, and also makes loads of different alternatives for slightly different needs.

## Learning

When you see a broken system, you might feel the need to get involved and repair it. After all, you don't want to settle for what you have now, for there are greener pastures in the horizons. However, not all broken systems can be fixed. A reluctant or overworked community and/or moderation, and other obstacles may stand in your way.

The only way to go forward now would be to emulate what you want the old system to be. Make a new system. Remix the old one. But create something new in itself; and alternative. You are not bound to forever use a broken machine.
