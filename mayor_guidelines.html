      <h2 id="part-1-the-mayor">Part 1: The Mayor</h2>

<h3 id="mayors-role">Mayor’s role</h3>

<p>The job of the Mayor is to act as the head moderator of the Town Discord server; to ensure the stability of the server and to protect the members. This is their only job.</p>

<h3 id="mayors-power">Mayor’s power</h3>

<p>The Mayor will not be given the ownership of the Discord server. Ownership of the Discord server will belong to a secondary, burner account. This is to ensure that — if a Mayor misbehaves — there can be measures in place to stop them, whilst not giving the full control of the server to another person. At the time of writing, this second account will belong to M.spicata, however, this is subject to change.</p>

<p>The Mayor will have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mayor</code> role, which will give them administrative powers. Only one member is to have this role at a time. Any Mayors found to have broken this rule will be demoted.</p>

<h3 id="limitations-of-mayors-power">Limitations of Mayor’s power</h3>

<p>The Mayor is not allowed to do some acts arbitrarily. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>changing a member’s nickname;</li>
  <li>muting members;</li>
  <li>deleting messages;</li>
  <li>kicking/banning members;</li>
  <li>limiting the channels that a member has access to; and</li>
  <li>removing/moving members from a call</li>
</ul>

<p>These things can only be done when there is a reasonable and valid purpose behind them, say for example, violating the Town’s Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>The following should never be done:</p>
<ul>
  <li>deleting #general or #announcements (or whatever they are named to in the future);</li>
  <li>deleting #call-1 and #call-2 (ditto); and</li>
  <li>giving other members elevated privileges for an extended duration</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="misc-changes">Misc. changes</h3>

<p>The Mayor is allowed to make miscellaneous and vanity changes to the Town, such as changing role colours or changing channel names.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-elections">Part 2: Elections</h2>

<h3 id="election-times">Election times</h3>

<p>From the 1st to 7th day of every second month (viz. January, March, May, July, September, November), there will be an election held for the Mayor’s position. This will be organised by the owner of the secondary (owner) account. If they are not available, it will be up to the members of the Town to elect someone to run the elections. Members are allowed to campaign and hype up the election at any time before the elections.</p>

<p>The elections <strong>may</strong> be postponed for up to a week if there are things going on during that time.</p>

<h3 id="applying-for-elections">Applying for elections</h3>

<p>To apply for the elections, contact the organiser of the election. Anybody is allowed to apply, including the current mayor, who will be running to be reelected.</p>

<h3 id="voting-system">Voting system</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_approval_voting">Combined approval voting</a> (on Microsoft Forms or Google Forms).</p>

<p>Members can either vote “for”, “indifferent”, or “against” for each candidate. The winner is the most liked candidate (can be calculated by subtracting the number of against votes from the number of for votes).</p>

<p>If the current Mayor is tied for first, they remain as the mayor. In the case of a tie excluding Mayor, leave it up to luck (like a coin flip).</p>

<p>During the election, the votes will anonymous and not open to the public. However, once the election is over, the stats will be revealed.</p>

<h3 id="votes-of-no-confidence">Votes of no confidence</h3>

<p>If the members in the Town see the current Mayor as unfit to rule, then a vote of no confidence can be called. This vote succeeds in overthrowing the Mayor when 75% (rounded up to the nearest person) of the members vote in favour of the vote. If the vote passes, then the current Mayor is overthrown.</p>

<p>A normal election proceeds. The next Mayor’s Mayorship is shortened.</p>

<h2 id="resigning">Resigning</h2>

<p>Mayors can resign. A normal election proceeds. The next Mayor’s Mayorship is shortened.</p>
