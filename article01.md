# Guide to Website: Staying Safe Online

> Honestly, I feel like I shouldn't really have to say this, because I'm assuming that all of you have also learnt of this. But I see you guys do it anyways, so here we are, I guess.

Please be safe on the internet. Just because you have a website doesn't mean that you should share everything about you on it. At the moment, it may feel like a safe haven for all of us to be comfortable, and in reality, it really should be like that. However, sadly, the internet often is not, so please take the necessary precautions on it.

## list

spicata's recommendations:
- Try to use a psuedonym online. I mean, it's fine if you use your name, but psuedonyms are usually better
- Please **don't** use your full names
- Don't say what age/grade you are in, preferably
- Don't say what school you go to
- Don't put contacts that you don't want to be contacted on. Like your phone number
    - Also, when you write your email addresses, write them like this: "address (at) email.com"; so that scrapers don't just take your email address.
- Don't share the names of people who are using pseudonyms

## examples

There are plenty of websites that seem to break some of these recommendations, so here are some examples...

> Hi, I'm Shan-Mei, a high school year 9 student from Australia  
> from smw's website

An incredible start to this section. Probably remove the part about "a high school year 9 student". If they know you, they don't need this information (redudant), and if they don't know you, they don't need to know this information. Similarly:

> as of 2023, I’m in year 11, doing ATAR  
> from jl's website

> Year 11  
> from tacoz' website

The second one is a little more subtle. Many members of the town has Year 11 and such as headers to organise their notes.

There is also the problem with using full names in websites. Here are some examples:

> Made by Athu Sathe

> Made by Tom Qiu

> beatricesychong.wixsite.com

> I am claudia choe

Please do not do this. You want to leave as little of a footprint on the internet at the moment, and anything dumb you do on your website may get linked back to you in the future. Better to just use a pseudonym you can get rid of at any time.

Additionally, if other people are using pseudonyms and usernames, don't use their actual names. The worst offenders would probably be:

=> http://nottaro.github.io/littleroot/NotTheTagArticles/14-05-2023-a-funny-conversation-i-found  
=> http://nottaro.github.io/littleroot/11Literature/Conference  
=> https://wanderer.toomwn.xyz/ (even linking them)

But I'm sure others do it too.

Also, more personal for me:

> She is M.Spicata’s sister  
> from pi-thagoras

Don't do this. This sucks.

## who does it well

I do it well. But, also here are the more notable people who do privacy a lot better than others
- pi-thagoras
- anonymous (maybe because his website's tiny)
- the merchant
- reaper

As for the rest, you can do better.

This is both a :-D and a >:-( moment.
