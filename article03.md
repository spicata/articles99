# Websites: Who are these notes for?

To those who care, if you are going to use your website to share notes, you probably want to do one of these:
- make it for yourself (or future you)
- make it for others

Rather than trying to make notes for both yourself and for others, you should try to focus on only one of them. This is because the notes that you require and others require are wildly different.

## making notes for yourself

When you make notes for yourself, you don't need a whole bunch of exposition and context. If you've made it, it just needs to be skimmable and understandable. This means that notes for youself usually just need to contain the important information and facts, and usually does not need all the information that is required before looking at that notes.

Usually, you would have another note for that context or would assume that you would know it already e.g. you don't need to explain what maths is when making a note about trig.

Why share it then? Firstly:

> Why the fuck not?  
> \- oscar

But also, working in the public :tm: is usually a good idea. As Jacky Zhao quoted:

> “[One] who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but [they] also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.”  
> \- Richard Hamming

jzhao is not the only person to say so. Here are some more examples because I like examples and they also add authority to whatever I'm saying:

## making notes for others

When you make notes for an external audience, you need to put in slightly more work. You usually assume that --- although they have *some* background knowledge --- they don't have most of it. This means that you often have to contextualise your notes e.g. giving them some background information. Essentially, you are explaining/teaching it to them.

This will usually reduce the frequency at which you release notes, because this will mean that you need to be more specific and more careful as well. I will assume that this is what Dasindu does, hence why it takes so long to make notes.

> I want to make sure my notes are smick-smack perfect  
> \- dasindu

Unlike Dasindu, also make sure not to fall into the trap of trying to make your notes perfect. Even if you think they are perfect, when you make these notes and publish them, people are bound to find problems. So although you don't want to publish unfinished notes, it can sometimes be better to publish it so that others can correct you.

Making notes for others is usually something that is more focused towards helping others, so good job.

tl;dr: you can either make notes for yourself, or for others. Each one of them have different things that are required.

That is the end this article. Yay!
