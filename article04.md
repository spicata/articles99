The Town is a wonderful place and an amazing community. The friendships and experiences I have forged while in it are those that I will remember moving onwards, and I cannot say in good conscience that any of you are bad people. Everyone took the time to set up a website; a website where they share notes, whether that be willingly or not. What more noble goal is there than the distribution of information and knowledge. Putting in the time and effort to teach possible strangers things you know is evidence itself for the good-willed nature of those that I share this space with.

However, I believe that the Town has entered a new era, one that has is very distinct from once it was. In many ways, I believe that this change to be a step backwards, and that we have distanced ourselves from the great possibilities that lie in the horizons, and I can find no other person to address other than the Mayor of the Town: Athu. So, I write this letter to the Town residents, but mainly to Athu.

# The Open Letter to Athu

For a while now, I have been making resources. Whether that be websites to share my notes, EP lists with friends, Anki flashcards sets, or journals to keep classmates up to speed. Moreover, I've made resources for the Town itself, a directory, a calendar where people can check when their assessments are, and continue to do so: making documentation that will help future Town joiners set up their websites, a hopefully shared resource bank, and more. I've aided people in making their websites, and ironing out the bugs from their code. Where there has been problems, I have tried to fix them.

Not everyone has anything to gain from these resources, and many disregard them altogether. However, I continue, investing time and energy because it is what I would've wanted them when I learnt. I would've loved to use Anki flashcard sets others made, or have a calendar where I could learn what I had. I make these because I know the frustrations of having to wade through sloppily and non-beginner friendly documentation in order to set up my website. I make these, because I know that there is people like me out there that would have loved to used these resources, and I hope that people in fact do. That is what motivates me to continue on with this project.

I know that there are others in the Town share this sentiment. People like Shan-mei and Kento, Jonathan and Ajay. Even now, they continue to put in work into their websites, and I can see the effort put into not only the notes, but the website themselves. They are meticulously crafted and friendly.

I also wish that the Town be used for something to inspire others; not only Town members, but also those outside of it as well. This is because I too was inspired by and continue to be inspred by those out there that do similar things. Jzhao, Maggie Appleton, Spencer Chang. Edward Hyunh. All of these people have inspired me to work harder and --- more importantly --- to care. I want the Town to be a similar place where people are able to be inspired by the work we do here.

So, why is it that I feel as though the Town in general has become more hostile? More wary of change and progress and innovation? Why is the atmosphere so heavy? I do not, and cannot blame the Town denizens for this. While I find that they do not do much to fix nor change this new environment we find ourselves in, I cannot find fault in their action. I believe them to just be following the general mood of the Town. Furthermore, when they see others struggle making changes, who is to blame them for not believing the possibility that the Town could be something greater?

But. I am particularly saddened that you (Athu), as the mayor, have not done much about it, and have instead opted to just embrace this hostility. Because it is also you, and maybe you alone, that can bring change to the Town, or at least allow it to happen. And whilst it is unrealistic to say that we should go back to prior times when 'things were better', I do not find it unreasonable that I demand that we should at least try to make the Town a better place.

Whilst I have been trying to make all these things and changes that I believe will benefit the Town, whether that be building a stronger community, or creating useful things, what have you done? It feels as though at every leg of the journey, you have only attempted to hinder me. At this point, I feel forced to ask. Do you even care for the Town? What is it that you want out of it? Reputation? A political plaything? Something to write on your resume?

For now, no amount of words that you say will renew my trust in the future nor the leadership of the Town, and it is only once you start taking non-superficial steps to improve that I can once again place my hope and dreams in you. And even with that said, if you still choose not to bring about any change, and prevent us from creating and inspiring, I will be disgusted and ashamed that we chose to call you the Mayor of our Town. I will be disappointed by the fact that our leader --- the protege of Edward, who would above all encourage people to do the things they wanted --- stands in the path of progress.

If nothing changes, there is nothing charming about the Town. As great as the Town members may be, they are also just people that I can meet outside of the Town. Ultimately, it is up to you, the leadership, to give the Town its own personality. Without it, I find no need to remain.

With the deepest regret,
