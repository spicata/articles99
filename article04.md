The Town is a wonderful place. That is what I truly believe, and I cannot say in good conscience that anyone in the Town is a bad person. Everyone took the time to set up a website; a website where they share notes, whether that be willingly or not. What more noble action is there than the distribution of information and knowledge, where you put in effort and time to teach possible strangers things you know. That democratisation of information is amazing.

However, I believe that the Town is not as great as it possibly could be, and I find no other person to blame other than the mayor of the Town: Athu. And so, I write this open letter to the Town, so they may consider where my ideas come from, but mainly to you, Athu, as a plea.

# An Open Letter to Athu

Dear Athu Sathe,

For quite a while now, I have been making resources. Whether that be websites to share information, EP lists with friends, Anki flashcards sets, journals to keep you up to date. Moreover, I've made resources for the Town itself, a directory, a calendar where people can check when their assessments are. I've aided people in setting up their websites, and ironing out the bugs from their code. Not everyone uses these resources, or gains things from them. Yet, I try, hoping that there exists at least one other person that can benefit from it.

I know others in the Town share this sentiment. I also believe that this ideal is more readily held by those who joined in the early days of the Town's development, and especially the founding figures. Not the ones who created the Notes Coalition, but those who were there during the Town's conception. So then why does it feel as though this idea has been warped, or even weaponised against us? Why does it feel like --- at least to me --- that the Town has become almost hostile towards progress and innovation.

I do not blame the Town denizens for this. I cannot find fault in their actions, because following the zietgeist is something that normal people do. When they see futile efforts in making changes, who is to blame them for not believing the possibility that the organisation that they are in could be something greater.

However. I am particularly saddened that you, as the mayor, have not done anything about it. Because it is also you, and maybe you alone, that can bring change to the Town. And whilst it is unrealistic to say that we should go back to prior times when 'things were better', I do not find it unreasonable that I demand that we should at least try to make the Town a better place.

I know that the Town can be something to inspire others. To inspire not only the townies, but also those outside of it. I know this, because I too was inspired or continue to be inspired by people out there who do this work. Jacky Zhao, Andy Matuschak, Maggie Appleton, Spencer Chang. Edward Hyunh. All of these people have inspired me to work harder and, more importantly, to care. Do you not have similar people who inspire you to do similar things? Do you not care?

Whilst I have been trying to make all these things and changes that I believe will benefit the Town, whether that be building a stronger community, or creating useful things, what have you done? It feels as though at every leg of the journey, you have only hindered me. So I must ask, why? At this point, I feel forced to question: what is it that you want out of the Town? Clout and reputation? A political plaything to exercise your power over? Nothing?

There are a multitude of insults I can hurl at you, and yet I won't. I know that you are a more complex being than the words that I can label you with, and I still carry the hope that you will make changes that will actively benefit the Town. But for now, no amount of words that you say to defend yourself can convince me that you will, and it is only once you start taking non-superficial steps that I can once again place my trust in you.

Even by the end, if you choose not to take any action, I will be disgusted and ashamed that we call you the Mayor of the Town. I will be disappointed by the fact that our leader --- the protege of Edward, who would above all encourage people to do the things they wanted --- stands in the path of advancement.

If nothing changes, there is nothing charming about the Town. As great as the Town members may be, they are also just people that I can meet outside of the Town. Ultimately, it is up to you, the leadership, to give the Town its own personality. Without it, I find no need to remain in the Town.

With the deepest regret,   
--- Christian "Mspicata" Choe
